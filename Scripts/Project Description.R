# This Project was made as a test to link a project that was
#  - made locally in my computer in RStudio
#  - Was not under verison control
#      - meaning that it was not linked to Git
#      - and not linked to GitHub
# So the following steps were taken:
# 1. A new project was created in RStudio
# 2. This project was linked to Git. We did this by:
#     i. Open Git Bash
#     ii. Change directory to the directory where this new project is in my harddrive
#         (cd F:/name/of/my/directory)
#     iii. Initialize this directory as git repository (git init)
#     iv. Add all the files in this directory to my local repository (git add .)
#     v. Commit these changes to the git repository (git commit -m "Initial commit")
# 3. This project was then linked to GitHub. We did this:
#     i. Go to GitHub.com, and again, create a new repository:
#         a) Make sure the name is the exact same as your R project;
#         b) Do NOT initialize a README file, .gitignore, or license.
#         c) Click Create Repository
#         d) Upon creating the repository, a page will appear which will have an option
#           to "push an existing repository from the command line
#         e) In Git Bash or Terminal, copy and paste these lines of code to 
#           link your repository with GitHub
#         f) Refresh the GitHub page.
#         g) When we re-open our project in RStudio, we can now have access to 
#             the Git tab in the upper right quadrant and can push to GitHub from 
#             within RStudio any future changes.
